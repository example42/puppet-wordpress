== USAGE - Basic management

* Install wordpress using your distro package, if available

        class { "wordpress": }

* Install the latest wordpress version from upstream site

        class { "wordpress":
          install             => "source",
        }

* Install the latest wordpress version from upstream site using puppi. 
  You will have a 'puppi deploy wordpress' to deploy and update wordpress.

        class { "wordpress":
          install             => "puppi",
        }

* Install source from a custom url to a custom install_destination path.
  The following parameters apply both for "source" and "puppi" install methods.
  Puppi method may be used to manage deployment updates (given the $install_source is updated).
  By default install_source is set to upstream developer and install_destination to Web (App) server document root
  Pre and post installation commands may be already defined (check wordpress/manifests/params.pp) override them only if needed.
  Url_check and url_pattern are used for application checks, if monitor is enabled. Override only if needed.

        class { "wordpress":
          install             => "source",
          install_source      => "http://deploy.example42.com/wordpress/wordpress.tar.gz",
        }

* Remove wordpress

        class { "wordpress":
          absent => true
        }

* Enable auditing without without making changes on existing wordpress configuration files

        class { "wordpress":
          audit_only => true
        }


== USAGE - Overrides and Customizations
* Use custom sources for main config file 

        class { "wordpress":
          source => [ "puppet:///modules/lab42/wordpress/wp-config.php-${hostname}" , "puppet:///modules/lab42/wordpress/wp-config.php" ], 
        }


* Use custom source directory for the whole configuration dir

        class { "wordpress":
          source_dir       => "puppet:///modules/lab42/wordpress/conf/",
          source_dir_purge => false, # Set to true to purge any existing file not present in $source_dir
        }

* Use custom template for main config file 

        class { "wordpress":
          template => "example42/wordpress/wp-config.php.erb",      
        }

* Automaticallly include a custom subclass

        class { "wordpress:"
          my_class => 'wordpress::example42',
        }


== USAGE - Example42 extensions management 
* Activate puppi (recommended, but disabled by default)
  Note that this option requires the usage of Example42 puppi module

        class { "wordpress": 
          puppi    => true,
        }

* Activate puppi and use a custom puppi_helper template (to be provided separately with
  a puppi::helper define ) to customize the output of puppi commands 

        class { "wordpress":
          puppi        => true,
          puppi_helper => "myhelper", 
        }

* Activate automatic monitoring (recommended, but disabled by default)
  This option requires the usage of Example42 monitor and relevant monitor tools modules

        class { "wordpress":
          monitor      => true,
          monitor_tool => [ "nagios" , "puppi" ],
        }
